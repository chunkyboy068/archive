            They say that where there is smoke, there is fire.  This turned out completely true, as my passion for technology burns bright like an everlasting  	 			flame.  The smoke? Well, it came from a burning cpu that I had taken the heatsink off of when I was 12. I was very curious back then and I still am.  This 		 			experience propelled me into the world of technology.  I built my first computer at age 16 and began programming at 17.

              Originally, I planned to get CompTIA A+ certified and begin work as a Computer Technician directly after high school.  Instead I made a last minute decision to pursue higher education and ended up at Virginia Tech.  I have not looked back since.  Did I waste time during all those months studying for the A+ exam? Nope.  If anything it helped me learn faster and more efficiently in college.  As a Computer Engineer, I have learned many skills in many different fields and I can still maintain my interests in computer hardware.    Moreover, I developed a sense of excellence and pride in what I do that exists to this day.

            This website was made almost entirely from scratch.  The original style template was taken from freecsstemplates.com because I am not very good at aesthetic design.  Everything else was written from scratch.  The original template required a large amount of modifications to accommodate additional features and style changes I wanted.  Other than the template, everything else was made from scratch.  Why? This website   			is my first foray into the world of web development.  I wanted to create something from the ground up as much as possible so that I will be more experienced if I decide to do  		 			something similar in the future (and I probably will).
